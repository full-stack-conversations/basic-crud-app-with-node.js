# basic-crud-app-with-node.js
**Starting point of the "full-stack-conversations" series of samples and tutorials.**

As explained in the README from the ["full-stack-conversations" collection of all samples and tutorials documents](https://github.com/full-stack-conversations/docs/blob/master/README.md), the main purpose of this collection is to present the benefits of using IAM PaaS providers for all Authentication and Authorization tasks in the context of JavaScript Full-Stack applications.

This mini-sample is the first in the series of "Okta based Autentication" and it barely touches the IAM functionality. It is added to the "full-stack-conversations" spaces for the reader's convenience (not to have to go to its [original repository](https://github.com/rdegges/okta-express-blog)). However, we will not create a local copy of its documentation - please check the [original tutorial](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2018/06/28/tutorial-build-a-basic-crud-app-with-node) for details of this sample costruction and functionality.
